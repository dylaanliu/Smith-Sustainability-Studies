# Smith-Sustainability-Studies

Queen's CISC 498 project

Done for a year-long capstone project course. The team consists of: 
Gabriel Bufardeci (Back End)
Seema Hejazi (Front End styling)
Dylan Liu (Back End & testing)
Emma Wong (Front End functionality and Back End)

The purpose of the web application was to create a tool to allow our customers to create, manage, and monitor studies.
In addition, to allow study participants to input, track and interact with other study participants.
